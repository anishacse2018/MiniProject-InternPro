              Our website deals with tracking the internships and projects done by the students.
The main aim of our project is to bring awareness among the students.
Anyone who wants to apply for an internship would surely want to create an effective resume.
We plan to create a resume building template to achieve this. 
It's a portal where students can update their internship status by giving the details of company,
their role,stipend,progress,etc.
It also provides an option for students to share their interview experiences 
and questions so that other students can benefit from it. 
We plan to organize live interactive sessions.We plan to provide a section where 
students can share their achievements. Based on the information provided graphs that is
 to provide a detailed analysis to every student will be generated.</p>
