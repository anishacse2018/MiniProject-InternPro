INTERNPRO is an internship management portal that acts as an interface between recruiters and students who are in search of internships. Both the recruiters and the students have different priviliges. Recruiters from a particular company can add and remove internships of that company. Students can use the resume builder provided by our website and apply for internships. The recruiter and the students can communicate with each other using chat application in our website itself. The technologies used for the front end include Reactjs, html,css while the database language is MySql. We used nodejs as a javascript run time environment and express js to create the web application and php to create APIs. The database concepts used include many to many relationships, primary key, foreign keys and triggers.
